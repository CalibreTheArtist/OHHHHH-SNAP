<title>The Short Flim: How I met your father.</title>

<body>The short Flim was a combinaton of ideas from of all involved. Titled "How I met your father" It was silent flim shot in times square with a added Black and white old timely filter. A story about women (Janka) getting her Purse snached by a theif ( Chris), and having it retrived by a man (Me). The requiment of the flims ranged from the creation of storyboreds ( Done by yours turely ^^). Theses storyboards are the foundation in which or flim was perfomed on. The storyboards are made to give an idea of how the actual flim will be conducted based on drawings. We also had to meet a certain amount speficic shots within the video, 22 shots in total. From establishing shots of the setting, headshots,wide and many more. Overall, Our short flim was one of great enjoyment and experince. With everyone involved having a turn at being the camerea person, director and actor. Much of the editing was done by chris, while a great deal of ideas came from janka. My storyboards and suggestings also contributed a lot as well. </body> 

<title>About Me</title>

<body>
Well I am a 21 year old student of BMCC. I have a passion of creation amongst many media's and Fields. I am incredibly driven and dedicated to what I do. Life can be can very busy and hectic at moments, and I do get overwhelmed trying to balance school work and at time. But but I know in my heart that hard work and dedication is what brings happiness. My love art is what drives me to being successful. Animation is my major and BMCC, and is what I will be taking I graduate and we want to a four-year school after my stay at BMCC. My passion of Animation stems from my love of drawing and creating, animation is an extension of drawing into the world of motion. A lot of hard work and time will be put into what I do and I plan on putting my best into it.

The Story Boards

As dissuced before. The story boards are the foundation for which the actual flim was based on. This is my largest and is the most significance part of the creation of the film, besides the film its self. Time square was the setting of the film. The 22 different shots where taken, and had extra care was needed when performing them. After the actaul filmming was done, the editing process was completed in Adobe Premiere. Once in Premire sound effects from youtube and other sound sampling websites, and royallity free music was added to fully create the sense of a silent flim we where going for. The black and white ecstatic was done within Adobe after effects and added to the editing process of premiere. And finally, the film once done the film was uploaded to the Youtube channel "Nomien"
