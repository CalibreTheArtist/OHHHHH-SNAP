Summary: I am an inspiring professional artist that aims to be successful. I wish to bestow upon the world the creations of my mind, wonders of my imagination and Beauty from my heart. Although I specialize in traditional hand drawing and painting, I'm currently learning digital platforms, techniques and and technology used to express art in magnificent ways. My learning is in its mere infancy, but I am slowly but surely growing. Here are a few project I've done so far, and a brief description of them.

 
<h2>My Skills:</h2>

<ul>
The new Emoji project.

<li
The the main idea of this project was to create a new emoji from scratch. Emojis or emoticons are small distinctfigures used to express emotion, feelings or general ideas towards something through a physical representation. Often use through text or  online writing. These figures range from smiley faces, crying face,s objects such as cars, Thunderbolt and many many more. The Emoji I present is an Emoji with a square head, yellow eyes and mouth, with a black texture. Rather than a standard emoji with a yellow circle body with black eyes and a black mouth. It is basically the opposite of the usual Emoji in every sense of the matter.

The short ball animation

<li
The the animation is a standard ball technique of illustrating motion through Photoshop. Based on the principles of animation techniques of speed, weight and shape. As the ball falls down and bounces it squishes creating the illusion of weight and bounce as it comes back up. An added effect comes from After Effects, showing a passage of the ball coming up and down with a transparent multiplying effect behind it.
</ul>

The logo: Beyond Infinite.

<li
“Beyond Beyound infinite is the logo of my imaginary company. Incorporates elements of the ARS suit from the video game Vanquish to show Power. With wings on added to the back through Photoshop to demonstrate Capability. The title” Beyond infinite” a play on the to infinity and beyond quote from the character Buzz Lightyear of Toy Story. This logo is an amalgamation of inspiration and imagination.
